# Linked List Elements

Adding elements to Linked List is much different than adding elements to an array. Elements can be added at the head of the list (i.e. before the first node), at the end of the list, between 2 nodes.

Here we will create 3 functions:

1. Add an element at the head of the linked list
2. Add an element at the end of a linked list in place. (Modify the current list)
3. Add an element at the end of a linked list but do so by returning a new list.

These functions complete the set of tools that are required to use linked list for more complicated tasks.
